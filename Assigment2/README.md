# Solidity Smart Contract Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of simple Solidity smart contracts that demonstrate various basic functionalities. Each contract is designed to address a specific task, such as storing data, counting, or implementing voting mechanisms. The contracts are well-documented with comments explaining their functionality.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into folders for different assignments, each containing the respective Solidity files:

- **Assignment 1**
  - `q1.sol`: Hello World Contract
  - `q2.sol`: Simple Storage Contract
  - `q3.sol`: Greeting Contract
  - `q4.sol`: Simple Counter Contract
  - `q5.sol`: Name Storage Contract
  - `q6.sol`: Basic Voting Contract
  - `q7.sol`: Owner Access Contract
  - `q8.sol`: Event Logging Contract
  - `q9.sol`: Simple Ledger Contract
  - `q10.sol`: Message Storage Contract

## Smart Contract Descriptions

### 1. **Hello World Contract (`q1.sol`)**
   - A simple contract that returns the message "Hello, World!" when called.

### 2. **Simple Storage (`q2.sol`)**
   - Allows users to store and retrieve a single integer value.

### 3. **Greeting Contract (`q3.sol`)**
   - Allows users to set and retrieve a personalized greeting message.

### 4. **Simple Counter (`q4.sol`)**
   - Keeps track of a count and allows it to be incremented.

### 5. **Name Storage (`q5.sol`)**
   - Stores and retrieves a user's name.

### 6. **Basic Voting (`q6.sol`)**
   - Implements a basic voting mechanism where users can vote for candidates and track the number of votes.

### 7. **Owner Access (`q7.sol`)**
   - Restricts certain functions to be executed only by the contract owner.

### 8. **Event Logging (`q8.sol`)**
   - Logs events when certain actions are performed within the contract.

### 9. **Simple Ledger (`q9.sol`)**
   - Maintains a ledger of transactions with basic entries, recording the sender and a message.

### 10. **Message Storage (`q10.sol`)**
   - Allows users to store and retrieve a message string.

## Usage

1. **Compilation**: Use the Solidity compiler (`solc`) or an online IDE like [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to compile the contracts.
2. **Deployment**: Deploy the contracts on an Ethereum test network (e.g., Ropsten, Rinkeby) or a local Ethereum network like [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache).
3. **Interaction**: After deployment, interact with the contracts via a web3 interface, like [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or using web3.js/ethers.js in a dApp.

## Prerequisites

- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) v0.8.0 or later
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm (for local development)
- [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) (for easy testing and deployment)

## Installation

To work with the contracts locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/YourGitHubUsername_AssignmentRepo.git
